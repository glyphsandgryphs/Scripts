# Scripts

This repository contains runnable utility scripts. Start with `scripts/sample_tool.py`, a command-line example that shows how to parse arguments, emit structured logs, and optionally mirror output to a log file or uppercase the generated greetings. See [`docs/scripts.md`](docs/scripts.md) for usage details and invocation examples.
